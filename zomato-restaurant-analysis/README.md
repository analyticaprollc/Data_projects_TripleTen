# **Zomato Restaurant Analysis**

**Analyst:** Kit Vine  
 **Tool:** Tableau  
 **Platform:** Zomato

## **Project Overview**

This project analyzes restaurant performance on the Zomato platform, focusing on revenue, order volume, cuisine types, customer ratings, location, and menu size. The goal is to uncover what makes a restaurant successful and provide data-driven recommendations.

## **Objectives**

Identify top-performing restaurants

Understand the impact of cuisine type and customer ratings

Evaluate how menu size and location affect performance

Provide strategic insights for business decision-making

## **Key Insights**

The top 10% of restaurants drive the majority of revenue. These are typically rated 4.2 or higher and offer Indian, Chinese, or Fast Food.

Cuisine type is a strong predictor of success — Indian and Chinese restaurants dominate.

Customer ratings strongly influence order volume — ratings above 4.2 are associated with 30–40% more orders.

Urban locations outperform rural and suburban ones by 1.5 to 2 times in both revenue and order volume.

The optimal menu size is 30–50 items. Menus exceeding 70 items tend to reduce performance due to complexity and decision fatigue.
